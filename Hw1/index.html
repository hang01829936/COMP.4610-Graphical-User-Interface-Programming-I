                Growing up, my parents never uttered the word love to me. Instead, they would bring me delicious food; and from then on, I associated food with love. I was not a very appreciative child; I was very picky with my food. However, as I grew older, I started to become more open-minded. I was fortunate enough to have the chance to taste food from other cultures made by classmates and friends. It opened a new door for me to appreciate different types of foods and the culture behind the food. I wanted to share two of my favorite recipes in this blog and how I came to make them.
