Through the readings and the video being a full stack developer, frontend, or backend seem to be an intriguing career choice. The frontend developers deal with the user interfaces such as the design and graphics of the website. This is such an interesting job as the front end is what the user sees first which makes a difference in how the user views the site. I would not trust a site with an outdated layout or incorrect spelling since those are prone to scams. The frontend development is more on the artistic and marketing of the website. It can be easily learned with some coding background since it involves more website graphic design. While on the other hand, the back end is the life of the website. Backend is what I have been learning throughout these years of college from comping I-IV. From my experience with coding with C++, I think the backend is the one that does the heaviest lifting for the website. From the reading, backend developers seem to have more on their plates. Backend developers need a stronger background in coding to better do their job. As it involved higher-level coding languages such as C++, Java, SQL, etc. It's also involved with the user and the website dataset, so it is more difficult. I think overall, it's interesting to be a full-stack developer as it involves both the art and code. As someone also interested in the design and the artistic part of computer science. I believe this could be a great career choice for me.
