              <p>My first visit to an Indian restaurant made me fall in love with Indian food. I couldn't believe I had been missing a delicious flavor from my life. As a college student, money is tight, so I decided to learn how to make some of my favorite dishes myself. It may be cheaper than the restaurant but the price of the spices deterred me from learning how to make one. Luckily, there is an Indian grocery store next to my favorite Indian restaurant and I can't believe how cheap the spices were compared to the American grocery store. I found my love for Indian cooking and make my variations of the food. It might not be authentic, but it's good enough for my taste buds! </p>

                  <h4>Special Note</h4>
                  <p> This dish is good at hiding leftover vegetables and proteins. Since I didn't have a heavy spice palette like many people who grow up eating this dish. I'd use this delicious sauce to freshen my leftover. I also sometimes put in some of my favorite vegetables, such as potato and mushroom for some texture differences. This dish might seem complicated but if you get the hang of it; it's really easy to make, very filling, and of course delicious!</p>
